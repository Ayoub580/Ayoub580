## 🖥️ Projects
### [Malware Detection using Machine Learning](https://github.com/yourusername/malware-detection)
- **Description**: Developed a malware detection system using Cuckoo Sandbox for dynamic analysis and XGBoost for classification.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Flask, Cuckoo Sandbox, scikit-learn, SMOTE for balancing datasets.
### Embedded Linux for Raspberry Pi
- **Description**: Created an embedded Linux system for Raspberry Pi using **Buildroot** to create a custom, lightweight distribution.
- **Technologies Used**:Buildroot, Linux kernel, Raspberry Pi.
## VoIP Project
- **Description**: In this VoIP project, I set up a telephony server based on Asterisk on the Trixbox platform. Three virtual machines were connected to the server, allowing users to make phone     calls over the Internet. This configuration provides an efficient and cost-effective communication solution by leveraging VoIP technology while benefiting from Asterisk's advanced features       for call management and related services.
- **Technologies Used**: Asterisk, Trixbox, VoIP, virtual machines.
  

## 📡 Wireless Sensor Projects
- Utilized **Castalia** and **Omnet++** for simulating wireless sensor networks to understand communication protocols and network behaviors.
### WSN (Wireless Sensor Networks)
- **Description**: Deployed Arduino nodes communicating with each other using Zigbee. The Sink communicates serially with the computer (using pyserial/Python) to plot the collected data in real      time.
- **Technologies Used**: Arduino, Zigbee, Python, pyserial.
